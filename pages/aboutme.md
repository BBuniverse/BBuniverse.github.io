I am an undergraduate student and study for a Bachelor of Advanced Computing Honours at ANU. Machine learning, Deep learning are my interested area. Overall, I would like to spend more time on Natural Language Processing. Personally, I think NLP can be used comprehensively. Such as translating, help the handicapped to understand the real world.

In my leisure time, watching movies can help me to get relax and get a better understanding of the wide world, so does a good reading habit. GYM can do me a favor to build a healthier body. As we all know, engineers or coders will spend a lot of time in front of the desk and computer, which should be taken seriously.
