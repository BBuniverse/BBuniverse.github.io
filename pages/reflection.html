        <p>Before I taking the COMP1710, I have a little background about how to build a personal webpage with purely
            HTML and CSS code.</p>
        <p>From now on, I am capable to use basic HTML code to build my web pages. The most interesting I figured out is
            using table elements to arrange the layout of a page. To be more specific, table elements have already
            contained a lot of table boxes, which can be assumed as different areas of our contents. Also, if we want to
            arrange an area more detailed, an inner table can still do a favor.</p>
        <p>During the development of adapting to different devices, the local information of each device is the critical
            point to design a readable web page. To explain it further, the readability of a page should have a strong
            relationship with the device screen&#39;s size and font size. The value of vw(Viewport Width) and
            vh(Viewport Height) will be changed once you open the same page on the different screen sizes. Therefore,
            once we choose to set design the size for different values on CSS based on vw and vh, those values will be
            automatically scaled, such as font size, margin, and padding.</p>
